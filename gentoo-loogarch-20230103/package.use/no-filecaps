# For stage building, we cannot be sure the final unpack destination will have
# xattr/fcaps support.  To be safe, we build stages without filecaps, but allow
# filecaps to be turned back on @ next full world upgrade.  The ebuilds using
# fcaps eclass will have more logic to safely fall back in case of missing
# support.
